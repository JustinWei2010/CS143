xsmall (used to test all input types)

simplest form
select * from xsmall																	1
select key from xsmall																	1
select value from xsmall																1
select count(*) from xsmall																1

Check if all key comparison work (since count(*) is executed in a different part of the code in comparison to the rest, they are tested separately)
select * from xsmall where key > 2														3
select * from xsmall where key >= 2														3
select * from xsmall where key < 2000													3
select * from xsmall where key <= 2244													3
select * from xsmall where key <> 2244													1
select * from xsmall where key = 2244													3
select count(*) from xsmall where key > 2												3
select count(*) from xsmall where key >= 2												3
select count(*) from xsmall where key < 2												3
select count(*) from xsmall where key <= 2												3
select count(*) from xsmall where key <> 2												1
select count(*) from xsmall where key = 2												3

Check if all value comparison work (since count(*) is executed in a different part of the code in comparison to the rest, they are tested separately)
select * from xsmall where value > 'F'													1
select * from xsmall where value >= 'Baby Take a Bow'									1	
select * from xsmall where value < 'F'													1
select * from xsmall where value <= 'Baby Take a Bow'									1				
select * from xsmall where value <> 'Baby Take a Bow'									1				
select * from xsmall where value = 'Baby Take a Bow'									1
select count(*) from xsmall where value > 'Baby Take a Bow'								1
select count(*) from xsmall where value >= 'Baby Take a Bow'							1
select count(*) from xsmall where value < 'Baby Take a Bow'								1
select count(*) from xsmall where value <= 'Baby Take a Bow'							1
select count(*) from xsmall where value <> 'Baby Take a Bow'							1
select count(*) from xsmall where value = 'Baby Take a Bow'								1

Combination Checks
select key from xsmall where key > 1													3
select key from xsmall where key > 1 and value = 'King Creole'							3
select key from xsmall where key > 1 and value <> 'King Creole'							3
select key from xsmall where key > 2500 and value = 'King Creole'						3
select * from xsmall where key > 100 and key < 2500										3
select * from xsmall where key > 2600 and key < 2500									2
select * from xsmall where value >  'K' and key > 2										3
select value from xsmall where value > 'K' and key > 3000								3
select count(*) from xsmall where value >  'K' and key > 2								3
select * from xsmall where value >  'K' and value < 'k'									1
select count(*) from xsmall where value >  'K' and value < 'k'							1

small (some basic checks on a larger tree)
select * from small																		6
select key from small																	6
select value from small																	6
select count(*) from small																1
SELECT * FROM small WHERE key > 100 AND key < 500										7
select key from small where key > 100													3

large
select * from large where key > 2000 and value < 'K'									141 (0.040)
select * from large where  value < 'K'													113 (0.290)
select * from large where key > 2000 and key < 2200										19 (0.050)
select * from large where key > 2000 and key < 2200	and value < 'K'						19 (0.040)
select * from large where value < 'K' and value > 'B'									113 (0.270)
select * from large where value < 'K' and key > 2200									128 (0.000)
select value from large where value < 'K' and value > 'B'								113 (0.270)
select count(*) from large where value < 'K' and value > 'B'							113 (0.000)
select key from large where key > 2000 and key < 2200									6 (0.040)
select count(*) from large where key > 2000 and key < 2200								6 (0.040)

Afterward, the standard test cases were done. (all of them passed)
